# Lungon
BASH Terminal Rogue-Like Game.

Lungon started as a rogue-like where players navigated the file system but as I realized that there were other things that I wanted in
it I also realized that the navigation was unrealistic and started creating a new game using the parts of the old one.
These files are here for anyone else who would like to make use of them and extend them for your own enjoyment.
